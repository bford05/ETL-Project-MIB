NFL Play Statistics Dataset

This repository represents an extract, transform, and load (ETL) example using NFL play statistics data. The purpose is to transform the data after extracting from a source and then loading it to a database where it can be consumed for analysis. 

Since the 2020 NFL draft begins on 4/23, we were inspired and curious to review historical data on players. To quench our thirst for NFL data, we scoured Kaggle and discovered a significant amount of statistics dating back to the 1970s. After further review, there were six sources provided by Kaggle that we found the most intriguing. If there were no time constraints we would analyze more but here is the list of statistics included in the respository for the project: players, draft, combine, receiver, rusher, and passer. These data sources includes information related to the draft year, team, age, hometown, height, weight, hand size, 40yd dash time, touchdowns, receptions, receiving yards, and so much more! It's an NFL fan's treasure cove of data! 


Data Sources

Kaggle was the primary source used to extract the NFL Play statistics Dataset. We downloaded six csv files to retrieve a wide range of statistics from over 40 years ago. The data also provides a link to each players profile for additional information. There is comprehensive data in the players, draft, combine, receiver, rusher, and passer csv files and covers information across the entire league for all teams.
